# You Lucky Dog 


## Description

This is a web application that allows users to search for dogs available for adoption in their area using a zipcode. This application 
specifically highlights dogs with special needs, older dogs and dogs which finding homes for is more difficult. Users are able to view adoptable dogs in their area and their details such as age, breed, size and gender. Information about the shelter where the dog is located is also shown when the user goes to the dog's profile page.  If a user identify any dogs that he/she would want to learn more information about at a later time, then he/she is able to save the dog’s profile to a favorites page and also fill out a form to contact the shelter regarding the dog.  You Lucky Dog is more than just a search platform but aim to provide users with resources, including what to expect with different dog breeds.

- As the user scrolls down, there is an input field for the user to type in a valid zipcode. The user is also given an option to choose a size, age or gender of the desired pet but a selection does not have to be made. Should the user give an invalid zipcode, a modal will appear advising that the zipcode is invalid. If the user fails to enter a zipcode at all, the user will be advised to enter in a zipcode.
